# Website Template

This repository contains a basic template for a React-based website written in TypeScript and Sass, with Webpack for bundling.

## Usage

Run `yarn install` to install all packages.
Then run `yarn start` to start the website at `localhost:8080`, or run `yarn build` to generate a production version of the site at `dist/`.
